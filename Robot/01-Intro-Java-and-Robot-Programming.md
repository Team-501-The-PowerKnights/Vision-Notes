# Session 1: Introduction to Java and Robot Programming

## General Programming
- Languages merely represent a way for humans to communicate with computers
  - In Java, the JVM, or Java Virtual Machine, compiles human-readable code to computer-executable code
- The theory of Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO) refers to the fact that computers are perfect in that always execute *exactly* what they are told to do - any errors result from poor input from the programmer. It is **NEVER** the robot's fault.
- Whenever you are attempting to solve any challenge or problem with code, it is important to first understand the theory, whether that is calculating the binary Hanning Distance, finding the surface area of a spheroid, or using gear ratios to parse encoder feedback from a drivetrain. **Understand the concept, not the code**

## Considerations for Robot Programming
- Robots are very real, very heavy, made of metal, and can move at high speeds, making them a potential hazard. It is **always** necessary to "write twice, run once" in terms of code to prevent injury.
  - Additionally, whenever you enable the robot, you must be wearing safety glasses, everyone else in the area must be wearing safety glasses, and you must announce "Robot Enabled" with a clear and strong voice.

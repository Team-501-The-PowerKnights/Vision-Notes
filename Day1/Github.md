# Github

## Cloning

To clone a repo you can get the git URL. You can find this URL under the green clone and download button on github.com for the repo. Once you have the git URL, you can clone it using the following command:

`git clone GIT_URL_GOES_HERE`

## Commits

Commits are a way of saving your work. You commit a file when you are done with the changes you are making to it. When writing a commit, you want it to be in present tense. Before making a commit, you need to stage the files that you are going to commit for. To check that status of all files, we run the following command in the command line:

`git status`
